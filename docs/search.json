    "text": "Introduction\nAsthma affects an estimated 262 million people and is the most common chronic disease among children1. It is caused by inflammation in the small airways of the lungs that leads to wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. While inhaled medications can manage effectively manage symptoms, if left untreated, asthma attacks can be fatal. In fact, over 450,000 people died from asthma worldwide in 2019.\nMany things can trigger asthma symptoms. One example is fine particulate matter (PM). Scientists measure PM at two scales, PM 10 and PM 2.5, where the number refers to the size of the particles in micrograms. PM 2.5 is especially concerning for people with respiratory conditions such as asthma because its small size means it can get into even the narrowest of airways, causing irritation and inflammation2.\nPM 2.5 comes from many sources, from industrial pollution to car exhaust, but recent research has shown that PM 2.5 from wildfires is particularly harmful3. As wildfire regimes become more volatile under climate change, more people will likely be exposed to these harmful particles4.\nWhile it is difficult to directly measure PM 2.5 from wildfires, one useful proxy for wildfire air pollution is air quality. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of how polluted the air is. It is calculated based on the concentrations of a number of common pollutants (Ozone, particulate matter, CO, NO2, SO2) present in the air5.\nThis analysis will use AQI data as a proxy for wildfire to explore how changing wildfire regimes are affecting the prevalence of asthma."

    "text": "Data\nI will use data from a number of sources to answer this question.\n\nYearly asthma hospitalization counts by county were retrieved from the California Health and Human Services (CHHS) Open Data Portal6. This data includes the number of asthma-related hospitalizations by county and year. It also provides strata by age various age groups. I filtered down to only the observations by total population, as I am interested in hospitalizations for all age groups. Additionally, data was only available from 2015-2022, so this became my time range of interest that I filtered the rest of my data to match.\nAir Quality Index (AQI) data by county was retrieved from the EPA7. This data includes various assessments of AQI at a yearly scale across California counties. AQI is available at a finer temporal scale, but I chose to look at yearly AQI data from 2015-2022 to match the temporal scale of the asthma data.\nFire frequency and area burned data was retrieved from CalFire8. This is a geodatabase of all the fire perimeters and associated fire information from 1858 until 2023 in California. I filtered down to just fires between 2015 and 2022 and calculated the total area burned by year and the total number of fires burned by year. While this data did not factor into my main analysis, it was useful in understanding the larger context of the question and looking for confounding variables.\nCounty level demographic information and geospatial data were retrieved from the United States Census Bureau9. This data contains information on population totals by county and year for California. It also has vector data on the county boundaries. This data was used to standardize the number of hospitalizations by the population size per county and to look for trends along latitude in hospitalizations. Similarly, this data was filtered to 2015-2022.\n\nBefore beginning my analysis, I cleaned the data such that I could join all my necessary information together. I divided the raw asthma hospitalization data by the population of each county, then multiplied by 100,000 to get the hospitalizations per 100,000 people. This was to account for the varying population sizes per county. I also capped the AQI value at 500 because that is the maximum standardized value listed on the EPA’s website for air quality. I converted the county boundary polygon data into coordinates to look for trends along latitude. Lastly, I used the area data and count data from CalFire to find the total acreage burned per year and total number of fires per year. This data was used to analyze trends in wildfires over time."

    "text": "Analysis plan\nFor my analysis, I chose a multiple linear regression model. I started by running simple linear regressions with single predictors to get a sense of what variables were and were not important to my analysis. I was interested in understanding if there was a linear relationship between wildfire PM 2.5 and asthma hospitalizations. Because I couldn’t find open access data that directly quantified PM 2.5 from wildfires, I used a variety of measures of air quality from the EPA’s Air Quality Index. I tried looking at the median AQI, maximum AQI, days with PM 2.5, days with ozone, and days unhealthy for sensitive groups or worse. While these predictors were similar, median AQI had the highest R2 and smallest p-value. There are large limitations here simply because I am using a proxy for wildfire PM 2.5 and I do not know what the relationship is between the AQI data I have and the wildfire PM 2.5 data I was unable to access.\nI also added demographic variables such as median per capita income and population density to see if these were important predictors of asthma hospitalizations. However, I found they were not significant.\nLastly, I incorporated spatial and temporal variables to see if those affected hospitalizations. There was no significant effect of latitude, but year was very significant. Thus, my final model looks as follows:\n\nMultiple linear regression model:\n\\[log(hosp\\_per\\_100k) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 median\\_aqi + \\beta_2year2015 ... \\beta_9year2022 + u_i\\] Where hosp_per_100k is asthma hospitalizations per 100,000 people. This variable has been log transformed to establish a linear relationship. median_aqi is the median aqi for that year. year represents the year of interest treated as a categorical variable.\nI chose to analyze year as a categorical variable because of the frequency with which the asthma data was collected. Since the asthma data is reported on a yearly basis, there is no intra-year variability in the data. Therefore, I decided to treat year as a categorical instead of a continuous numerical variable. There are 8 years of data included in my analysis, but the formula here does not list all of them for brevity.\nThe next step in my analysis plan was to check for autocorrelation because I was using time series data. Autocorrelation can occur in temporal and spatial data sets because data collected near each other in space and time have the potential to be more similar to each other. I used the autocorrelation function acf on the residuals from my linear model and there was no obvious autocorrelation in my data."

Sorry about that!\nThe results of the linear model show that median AQI and all years of interest had significant coefficients at the 0.05 significance level. Additionally, the adjusted R2 of 0.586 tells us that ~58.6% of the variability in hospitalizations can be explained by median aqi and year. However, if we examine the R2 values from my earlier preliminary models, we can see roughly what the breakdown of this multiple linear regression is.\n\n\n[1] \"R squared for median aqi as sole predictor: 0.07\"\n\n\n[1] \"R squared for year as sole predictor: 0.51\"\n\n\nWhen we take into account all three R2 values together, we can see that roughly 7% of the variation in the complete model comes from median AQI, and roughly 51% of the variation from year.\n\n\nModel visualization\nNext, we can plot the parts of our linear model results to see how well our predicted line fits our data.\n\n\nReveal code\nggplot(asthma_aqi, aes(median_aqi, log(hosp_per_100k))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n              se=FALSE,\n              color=\"red\") +\n  labs(title=\"Hospitalizations and Median AQI\",\n       x=\"Median AQI\",\n       y=\"log(Hospitalizations per 100k)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows how hospitalizations are changing with median AQI through time. There is a weak, positive, linear relationship between median AQI and hospitalizations with no obvious outliers. We can also see our line of best fit. The residuals for this particular model were evenly distributed and showed no trend.\nWe can also visualize how hospitalizations are changing with time.\n\n\nReveal code\nggplot(asthma_aqi, aes(as.factor(year), log(hosp_per_100k))) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=as.factor(year))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n    labs(title=\"Hospitalizations by Year\",\n       x=\"Year\",\n       y=\"log(Hospitalizations per 100k)\",\n       fill=\"Year\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the boxplot of hospitalizations by year. While we cannot plot our best fit line onto this graph, we can see that hospitalizations seem to be decreasing with time. This tracks with our estimated coefficients from our above multiple regression model. Every coefficient for year after the reference level of 2015 is negative, showing how hospitalizations are decreasing in magnitude relative to 2015."

    "text": "Conclusions and next steps\nOverall, these results only provide very weak evidence that there is a relationship between wildfires and respiratory health. While the results of my model were significant, there were many limitations in the data I was using that could be affecting my results. For example, a large limitation of this analysis was the lack of finer temporal scale data for asthma-related hospitalizations. All of the other datasets I was using had data available at the daily and sometimes even hourly time scale. Because I had to aggregate data about AQI to such a broad time scale, much of the variation in AQI across seasons is lost. There are certain asthma triggers that are seasonal, such as pollen in the spring or cold air in the winter. Being able to track how month-to-month seasonality is affecting hospitalizations would be a great next step.\nAnother limitation was that I was unable to find any open-source data on PM 2.5 directly from wildfires. This meant I was unable to examine a direct relationship between wildfire and asthma hospitalizations, I could only use AQI as a proxy. There certainly is data on wildfire PM 2.5, and if given more time, I would reach out to the data owners and authors of papers who have published scholarship on this topic to try and request access to the data.\nLastly, this analysis contained many omitted variables that might be influencing trends in asthma hospitalizations over time.\nFor example:\n\n\nFires and hospitalizations over time\n# Plot change in area burned over time\nfire_plot &lt;- ggplot(fire_asthma, aes(year, total_area)) +\n  geom_col(fill=\"firebrick\") + \n  geom_col(data = . %&gt;% filter(year == 2020),\n           color=\"red\",\n           fill=\"firebrick\",\n           lwd=1) +\n  labs(title=\"Total Area Burned by Wildfires\\nin California by Year\",\n       x=\"Year\",\n       y=\"Area burned (acres)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n    theme(axis.title = element_text(size=12),\n        title = element_text(size=12))\n\n# Plot change in hospitalizations over time\nhosp_plot &lt;- ggplot(fire_asthma, aes(year, total_hosp_capita)) +\n  geom_col(fill=\"cornflowerblue\") +\n  geom_col(data = . %&gt;% filter(year == 2020),\n           color=\"red\",\n           fill=\"cornflowerblue\",\n           lwd=1) +\n  labs(title=\"Total Asthma Hospitalizations\\nper 100k in California by Year\",\n       x=\"Year\",\n       y=\"Hospitalizations per 100K\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(size=12),\n        title = element_text(size=12))\n\nfire_plot | hosp_plot  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the total area burned by wildfires in California from 2015 to 2022, and the total number of asthma hospitalizations per 100k people in California from 2015-2022. The year 2020 in particular stands out. Despite it being a record year for the amount of area burned in the state, it was also the year with the fewest hospitalizations. An obvious factor that is likely influencing this is COVID-19. The shelter-in-place mandates likely greatly influenced people who were seeking out asthma care, even if there were more wildfires that year.\nThis is just one example of an important cause of variation in asthma hospitalizations that I was unable to capture in my model. Going forward, I would like to have access to much more comprehensive data to truly unpack the connection between wildfires and respiratory health.\n\nReferences\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis code is based on material from Max Czapanskiy for EDS-222: Statistics for Environmental Data Scientists."

False color imagery, created using satellite data from instruments like Landsat, is a useful tool for monitoring wildfire impacts. By assigning infrared bands to visible colors, these images highlight vegetation health, burn severity, and the extent of fire scars. This approach helps researchers and land managers assess recovery efforts, identify high-risk areas, and plan restoration strategies.\nPart 2 will create a false color image of the Thomas Fire using remote sensing data, highlighting the fire scar and exploring how coding and data visualization support environmental monitoring.\n\n\nHighlights\n\nImport Thomas fire perimeter data with geopandas and os\nImport Landsat data with rioxarray and os\nExplore and clean geospatial data with pandas and rioxarray\nConstruct a true color image of the Thomas Fire with rioxarray\nConstruct a false color image of the Thomas Fire with rioxarray\nVisualize the Thomas Fire false color scar with the fire perimeter data using matplotlib\n\n\n\nAbout the Data\nThe Landsat data is a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. It was pre-processed in the Microsoft Planetary data catalogue to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution\nThe Thomas Fire perimeter data comes from CalFire’s data portal. CalFire is the department of forestry and fire protection. They have a Geodatabase of all historical fire perimeters in the state of California from 1878 until present. The database includes information on the fire date, managing agency, cause, acres, and the geospatial boundary of the fire, among other information. This data was pre-processed to select only the Thomas fire boundary geometry."

The fire boundary is outlined in red. Satellite data works with wavelengths of light beyond what the human eye can see. False color imagery is the process of assigning colors to these wavelengths (i.e. near-infrared and short-wave infrared). In our map, we’ve chosen to visualize short-wave infrared as red, near-infrared as green, and red wavelengths as blue. This lets us produce an image that highlights exactly where the fire scar is, as opposed to the true color image where it is much harder to distinguish. A true color image assigns the red, green, and blue wavelengths of light to the correct corresponding colors.\n\nReferences\n\nAir Quality Index (AQI) from US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nUS Environmental Protection Agency.

    "text": "The snap of the twig outside your tent in the dead of night, the dizzying swoop of your stomach when you look over a high ledge. Your palms sweat, your heart races. Fear is designed to keep us alive–a mechanism we’ve evolved to assess threats to our safety.\nEcologists, in particular, think about fear in many ways. They’ve coined the term “landscapes of fear,” which is a framework to describe how prey perceive and respond to the risk of predation (Bleicher 2017). For example, to a deer, the best food in the forest might be in the center of the open meadow, but the deer is also aware that being in the open meadow makes them an obvious target to the mountain lion. While ecologists consider how fear affects the decision-making of species, new scholarship has posed a different perspective: how does fear affect the decision-making of the ecologists themselves?\nA recent publication by Gabriel Gadsden, Nigel Golden, and Nyeema Harris repurposes this term into what they call social-ecological landscapes of fear, that is, a landscape of fear derived from the impact of negative human histories across space (Gadsden et al. 2023). They call for the inclusion of negative human histories as important drivers of landscape change. This means considering the legacy of “mortality, extermination, subordination, and dispossession related to ethically controversial conditions, including overpolicing, redlining, racial or ethnic violence, corrupt governments, low social capital, and segregation” across space and time (Gadsden et al. 2023). They also posit that failing to address negative human histories generates a place-based bias that affects where and how scientists conduct research.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Conceptual graphic of the problematic framing of landscapes in conventional conservation and environmental scholarship where landscapes are dichotomized between pristine ecologically relevant and degraded landscapes. (a) Green space (b) Nature trails (c) Charismatic megafauna (d) Suburban neighborhood (e) Nuisance wildlife (f) Cityscape (g) War and conflict (h) Forced removal (i) Redlining (j) Land conversion (k) Pollution (l) Industry\n\n\nThis fear-based dismissal of landscapes manifests in how scholars decide what are considered intact environments. One example of social-ecological landscapes of fear causing place-based bias is the dismissal and erasure of land due to pollution. The case study I will use to discuss these ideas is uranium mining in the Navajo Nation."

    "section": "Case Study: Uranium Mining on Navajo Land",
    "text": "Case Study: Uranium Mining on Navajo Land\nIn the 1940s, uranium mining began in the U.S. when the Atomic Energy Commission was seeking a local source of uranium to supply nuclear power plants (Brugge & Goble 2002). Several areas in the Southwestern United States were selected as suitable sites, including land on the Navajo Nation. For the next 40 years, Navajo people and other community members would work in radioactive mines where they were exposed to harmful chemicals known to cause lung cancer. However, thanks to the tireless work of Navajo activists and public health officials, these mines were eventually shut down. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) was passed in 1990, in which the U.S. government acknowledged its responsibility for the mistreatment of miners and provided financial compensation for illness.\nWhile RECA was a huge step forward, remediation and cleanup of radioactive waste is still an active problem in the region today (Arnold 2014). Remediation is a primary focus of research in the area, but the scientific literature around the mines in the Navajo Nation still predominantly centers on narratives of deficit and dysfunction. Connecting this legacy to social-ecological landscapes of fear, I argue that the negative histories around radioactive pollution have created an underlying place-based bias in the environmental literature of the region. The perception of the landscape as degraded has led to a dismissal of the region as important for conservation efforts. While data bias can come from many sources, in this case, the place-based bias originates from the underlying frameworks researchers use for analysis. One of the first steps in experimental design is selecting a study site and population. If your selection process does not consider landscapes across a spectrum of negative human histories equally, then you are generating a place-based selection bias in your methods."

    "text": "The Impact of Place-Based Bias\nWhen researchers do not perceive landscapes equally, then they do not study those landscapes equally. Place-based bias in environmental scholarship means conservation efforts are overvaluing places seen as “pristine” while undervaluing areas seen as “degraded.” For example, Chapin discusses how large conservation organizations have historically seen places where Indigenous people reside as unfit for conservation because they prioritize “their economic wellbeing over preservation of natural resources” (Chapin 2004). Indigenous nations want the autonomy to manage their lands and resources as they see fit. Yet because their decision-making on that land now marks it as less than pristine from the dominant global north perspective, it becomes understudied and undervalued. Their mere presence on the land adds it to the subconscious social-ecological landscape of fear that underpins dominant science research.\nIn the case of the Navajo people, the landscape of fear around the legacy of the mines has meant a lack of consideration of the ecological value of the region, such as its biodiversity and ecosystem services. When the dominant narrative of a place becomes entrenched in its complicated past, then it is easy to reduce that place down to its worst qualities. This reductionism occurs not only to the physical space itself but also to the people who occupy that space.\nPlace-based bias can also be readily found across urban and suburban landscapes. Community science data, for example, often display a strong bias toward areas the participants find enjoyable, aesthetically pleasing, or safe. This leads to an oversurveying of urban green spaces and an undersurveying of dense cityscapes (Carlen et al. 2024). Negative human histories of redlining, segregation, and discrimination shape what urban areas are desirable to conduct community science, and what urban areas are erased from the narrative. These factors contribute to the social-ecological landscape of fear that guides environmental scholarship.\nPlace-based bias from landscapes of fear is a subtle, pervasive bias across environmental literature. As researchers, we must acknowledge that true objectivity does not exist. There are always unknown unknowns that impact our decision-making. By calling attention to how fear colors our perception of landscapes, we can turn this place-based bias into a known unknown. While recognition of the impact of negative human histories on research is the first step, there are also solutions to mitigate the effects of landscapes of fear."

    "text": "Solutions\nPlace-based bias generated from landscapes of fear can be mitigated by two broad paths: recognizing negative histories, and the collaborative cocreation of knowledge with community members. Recognizing histories starts with an acknowledgment of past harm. In environmental scholarship, a common example is land acknowledgments. Situating your research in the larger colonial context is a simple and effective first step toward shedding light on potential negative human histories associated with your work.\nCommunity collaboration and cocreation go beyond acknowledgement and seek to create meaningful connections with the people who live in places of interest. It also involves scrutinizing underlying power structures and cocreating new methods that seek to rectify an imbalance of power. The rise of indigenous data sovereignty and data methods is an example of a framework that gives authority back to historically marginalized groups. This means bringing capacity for research to Indigenous communities, such as data collection, analysis, and reporting methods, and advocating for Indigenous research methodologies to be prioritized and respected in academic settings (Walter & Suina 2019). This also looks like shifting the narrative around the values that underpin data collection and use. For example, the CARE principles for Indigenous data governance center on collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics (Carrol et al. 2020).\nAs researchers from a settler colonial positionality, recognizing the data sovereignty of Indigenous peoples and prioritizing CARE principles in our underlying framework of data science is the first step toward cocreating knowledge with Indigenous communities. However, it is important to mention that these things only matter if you have been invited in. The legacy of colonialism is fraught with violence. Approaching collaboration from a place of humility, introspection, and respect is necessary to ensure collaborative efforts don’t reproduce harm.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. A guide designed as a catalyst to overcome social–ecological landscapes of fear in environmental scholarship (Gadsden et al. 2023).\n\n\nThese principles of acknowledgement and cocreation apply to all community groups that exist in spaces impacted by negative human histories. As environmental scientists invested in conserving the world around us–both people and place–we must listen and understand the stories of negative human histories across landscapes. Only by having the full perspective can we make informed decisions about how we study natural spaces. Often, we fear things simply because we do not understand them. But knowledge disrupts fear, and as researchers, we must respect and value the knowledge of those who live in the landscapes we study."

    "text": "The snap of the twig outside your tent in the dead of night, the dizzying swoop of your stomach when you look over a high ledge. Your palms sweat, your heart races. Fear is designed to keep us alive–a mechanism we’ve evolved to assess threats to our safety.\nEcologists, in particular, think about fear in many ways. They’ve coined the term “landscapes of fear,” which is a framework to describe how prey perceive and respond to the risk of predation (Bleicher 2017). For example, to a deer, the best food in the forest might be in the center of the open meadow, but the deer is also aware that being in the open meadow makes them an obvious target to the mountain lion. While ecologists consider how fear affects the decision-making of species, new scholarship has posed a different perspective: how does fear affect the decision-making of the ecologists themselves?\nA recent publication by Gabriel Gadsden, Nigel Golden, and Nyeema Harris repurposes this term into what they call social-ecological landscapes of fear, that is, a landscape of fear derived from the impact of negative human histories across space (Gadsden et al. 2023). They call for the inclusion of negative human histories as important drivers of landscape change. This means considering the legacy of “mortality, extermination, subordination, and dispossession related to ethically controversial conditions, including overpolicing, redlining, racial or ethnic violence, corrupt governments, low social capital, and segregation” across space and time (Gadsden et al. 2023). They also posit that failing to address negative human histories generates a place-based bias that affects where and how scientists conduct research.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Conceptual graphic of the problematic framing of landscapes in conventional conservation and environmental scholarship where landscapes are dichotomized between pristine ecologically relevant and degraded landscapes. (a) Green space (b) Nature trails (c) Charismatic megafauna (d) Suburban neighborhood (e) Nuisance wildlife (f) Cityscape (g) War and conflict (h) Forced removal (i) Redlining (j) Land conversion (k) Pollution (l) Industry\n\n\nThis fear-based dismissal of landscapes manifests in how scholars decide what are considered intact environments. One example of social-ecological landscapes of fear causing place-based bias is the dismissal and erasure of land due to pollution. The case study I will use to discuss these ideas is uranium mining in the Navajo Nation."
