    "text": "Haylee Oyler has always been interested in studying the intersection of people and nature. She graduated with honors from the University of California, Berkeley in 2021 with a degree in Environmental Science. There, she worked on multiple research projects about human-environment interactions. Haylee’s first introduction to working with large data was her senior thesis. She used open-access data from the platform eBird to analyze trends in citizen science participation during the COVID-19 pandemic. She was captivated by the power and scope of community-centered data and became even more intrigued by questions of access, equity, and representation in who contributes to the data.\nNow, Haylee is a Master of Environmental Data Science student at the University of California Santa Barbara. She is excited to apply data science tools to study human-environment interactions, specifically issues of environmental justice, equitable climate change transitions, and community-based conservation. Her ethos for approaching environmental problems centers first and foremost on people, particularly the participation and experience of marginalized groups."

    "text": "Introduction\nAsthma affects an estimated 262 million people and is the most common chronic disease among children1. It is caused by inflammation in the small airways of the lungs that leads to wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. While inhaled medications can manage effectively manage symptoms, if left untreated, asthma attacks can be fatal. In fact, over 450,000 people died from asthma worldwide in 2019.\nMany things can trigger asthma symptoms. One example is fine particulate matter (PM). Scientists measure PM at two scales, PM 10 and PM 2.5, where the number refers to the size of the particles in micrograms. PM 2.5 is especially concerning for people with respiratory conditions such as asthma because its small size means it can get into even the narrowest of airways, causing irritation and inflammation2.\nPM 2.5 can come from many sources, from industrial pollution to car exhaust, but recent research has shown that PM 2.5 from wildfires is particularly harmful3. As wildfire regimes get more more volatile and extreme under climate change, more people will be exposed to these harmful particles4.\nWhile it is difficult to directly measure PM 2.5 from wildfires, one useful proxy for wildfire air pollution is air quality. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of how polluted the air is. It is calculated based on the concentrations of a number of common pollutants (Ozone, particulate matter, CO, NO2, SO2) present in the air5.\nThis analysis will use AQI data as a proxy for wildfire to explore how changing wildfire regimes are affecting the prevalence of asthma."

    "text": "Data\nI will use data from a number of sources to answer this question.\n\nYearly asthma hospitalization counts by county were retrieved from the California Health and Human Services (CHHS) Open Data Portal6. This data includes the number of asthma-related hosptitalizations by county and year. It also provides strata by age various age groups. I filtered down to only the observations by total population, as I am interested in hospitalizations for all age groups. Additionally, data was only available from 2015-2022, so this became my time range of interest that I filtered the rest of my data to match.\nAir Quality Index (AQI) data by county was retrieved from the EPA7. This data includes various assessments of AQI at a yearly scale across California counties. AQI is available at a finer temporal scale, but I chose to look at yearly AQI data from 2015-2022 to match the temporal scale of the asthma data.\nFire frequency and area burned data was retrieved from CalFire8. This is a geodatabase of all the fire perimeters and associated fire information from 1858 until 2023 in California. I filtered down to just fires between 2015 and 2022 and used calculated the total area burned by year and the total number of fires burned by year. While this data did not factor into my main analysis, it was useful in understanding the larger context of the question and looking for confounding variables.\nCounty level demographic information and geospatial data were retrieved from the United States Census Bureau9. This data contains informations on population totals by county and year for California. It also has vector data on the county boundaries. This data was used to standardize the number of hospitalizations by the population size per county. Similarly, this data was filtered to 2015-2022.\n\nBefore beginning my analysis, I cleaned the data according to “Tidy Data” format such that I could join all my necessary information together. I divided the raw asthma hospitalization data by the population of each county, then multiplied by 100,000 to get the hospitalizations per 100,000 people. This was to account for the varying population sizes per county. I also capped the AQI value at 500 because that is the maximum standardized value listed on the EPA’s website for air quality. Lastly, I used the area data and count data from CalFire to find the total acreage burned per year and total number of fires per year. This data was used to analyze trends in wildfire over time."

    "section": "Analysis plan",
    "text": "Analysis plan\nFor my analysis, I started with a linear regression model. This was my first approach because at the start, I just wanted to understand if there was a linear relationship between wildfire PM 2.5 and asthma hospitalizations. Because I couldn’t find open access data that directly quantified PM 2.5 from wildfires, I used a variety of measures of air quality from the EPA’s Air Quality Index. I tried looking at the median AQI, maximum AQI, days with PM 2.5, days with ozone, and days unhealthy for sensitive groups or worse. While these predictors were similar, median aqi had the highest R2 and smallest p-value. There are some limitations here simply because I am using a proxy for wildfire PM 2.5 and I do not know what the relationship is between the AQI data I have, and the wildfire PM 2.5 data I was unable to access.\nI also added demographic variables such as median per capita income and population density to see if these were important predictors of asthma hospitalizations. However, I found they were not signifcant.\nThe last variable I tried was year, had a large R2 value and a significant p-value.\n\nModel 1: Linear model\nOverall, my first model looks like this:\n\\[log(hosp\\_per\\_100k) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 median\\_aqi + \\beta_2year + u_i\\] Where hosp_per_100k is asthma hospitalizations per 100,000 people. This variable has been log transformed to establish a linear relationship. median_aqi is the median aqi for that year. year represents the year of interest.\nThe next step in my analysis plan was to check for autocorrelation because I was using time series data. Autocorrelation can occur in temporal and spatial data sets because data collected near each other in space and time have the potential to be more similar to each other. I used the autocorrelation function acf on the residuals from my first linear model to see if there was any autocorrelation. As it turns out, there was. So, I turned to a new analysis.\n\n\nModel 2: Autoregressive distributive lag model\nBecause my data was highly autocorrelated, I decided to use an autoregressive distributive lag model next. This model lags the response of the\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nlog(hosp\\_per\\_100k)[t] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 median\\_aqi[t] + \\beta_2year[t] + \\beta_3log(hosp\\_per\\_100k)[t-1] + \\\\\n                          \\beta_4 median\\_aqi[t-1] + \\beta_5year[t-1] + u_i\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWhere t is our data at time = t and t-1 is our data at time = t-1.\nThe ADL model accounted for much of the autocorrelation in the residuals of my first linear model."

The data still exhibits a large amount of positive autocorrelation.\nA big limitation of this analysis was the lack of finer temporal scale data for asthma-related hospitalizations. All of the other datasets I was using had data available at the daily and sometimes even hourly time scale. Because I had to aggregate data about AQI to such a broad time scale, much of the variation in AQI across seasons is lost. There are certain asthma triggers that are seasonal, such as pollen in the spring or cold air in the winter. Being able to track how month-to-month seasonality is affecting hospitalizations would be a great next step.\nAnother limitation was that I was unable to find any open-source data on PM 2.5 directly from wildfires. This meant I was unable to examine a direct relationship between wildfire and asthma hospitalizations, I could only use AQI as a proxy. There certainly is data on wildfire PM 2.5, and if given more time, I would reach out to the data owners and authors of papers who have published scholarship on this topic to try and request access to the data.\n\nReferences"

    "text": "About\n\nPurpose\nPart 2 of this analysis details the steps to visualize Landsat multispectral geospatial data for the 2017 Thomas Fire. The Thomas Fire, which burned over 280,000 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in December 2017, was one of California’s largest wildfires at the time. It caused widespread ecological damage, displaced communities, and left lasting environmental impacts.\nFalse color imagery, created using satellite data from instruments like Landsat, is a useful tool for monitoring wildfire impacts. By assigning infrared bands to visible colors, these images highlight vegetation health, burn severity, and the extent of fire scars. This approach helps researchers and land managers assess recovery efforts, identify high-risk areas, and plan restoration strategies.\nPart 2 will create a false color image of the Thomas Fire using remote sensing data, highlighting the fire scar and exploring how coding and data visualization support environmental monitoring.\n\n\nHighlights\n\nImport Thomas fire perimeter data with geopandas and os\nImport Landsat data with rioxarray and os\nExplore and clean geospatial data with pandas and rioxarray\nConstruct a true color image of the Thomas Fire with matplotlib\nConstruct a false color image of the Thomas Fire with matplotlib\nVisualize the Thomas Fire false color scar with the fire perimeter data using matplotlib\n\n\n\nAbout the Data\nThe Landsat data is a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. It was pre-processed in the Microsoft Planetary data catalogue to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution\nThe Thomas Fire perimeter data comes from CalFire’s data portal. CalFire is the department of forestry and fire protection. They have a Geodatabase of all historical fire perimeters in the state of California from 1878 until present. The database includes information on the fire date, managing agency, cause, acres, and the geospatial boundary of the fire, among other information. This data was pre-processed to select only the Thomas fire boundary geometry."

The fire boundary is outlined in red. Satellite data works with wavelengths of light beyond what the human eye can see. False color imagery is the process of assigning colors to these wavelengths (i.e. near-infrared and short-wave infrared). In our map, we’ve chosen to visualize short-wave infrared as red, near-infrared as green, and red wavelengths as blue. This lets us produce an image that highlights exactly where the fire scar is, as opposed to the true color image where you it is much harder to distinguish. A true color image assigns the red, green, and blue wavelengths of light to the correct corresponding colors.\n\nReferences\n\nAir Quality Index (AQI) from US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nUS Environmental Protection Agency.
