    "text": "Haylee Oyler has always been interested in studying the intersection of people and nature. She graduated with honors from the University of California, Berkeley in 2021 with a degree in Environmental Science. There, she worked on multiple research projects about human-environment interactions. Hayleeâ€™s first introduction to working with large data was her senior thesis. She used open-access data from the platform eBird to analyze trends in citizen science participation during the COVID-19 pandemic. She was captivated by the power and scope of community-centered data and became even more intrigued by questions of access, equity, and representation in who contributes to the data.\nNow, Haylee is a Master of Environmental Data Science student at the University of California Santa Barbara. She is excited to apply data science tools to study human-environment interactions, specifically issues of environmental justice, equitable climate change transitions, and community-based conservation. Her ethos for approaching environmental problems centers first and foremost on people, particularly the participation and experience of marginalized groups."
